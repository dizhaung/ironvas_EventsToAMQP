/**
 * A <code>Converter</code> is capable of mapping {@link Vulnerability}
 * instances to IF-MAP data structures for processing with <code>ifmapj</code>.
 * The implementation of this interface is free to choose if a
 * {@link Vulnerability} instance is mapped exact to one IF-MAP representation
 * (e.g. event) or if the information is distributed over more than one
 * representation (e.g. event and some special schema). Furthermore the
 * implementation of a <code>Converter</code> is free to choose what kind of
 * publish operation (update or notify) is executed.
 * <p>
 * Note that the transformation must be symmetric for updates and deletes. This
 * means that if one {@link Vulnerability} object is mapped to more than one
 * representation, the delete-mapping for the same {@link Vulnerability} object
 * must result in a complete delete operation for all previously generated
 * representation of that {@link Vulnerability}.
